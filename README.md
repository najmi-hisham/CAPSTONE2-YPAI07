# CRACKS OR NOT

Crack Or Not Classification using transfer learning (MobilNetV2)

# INTRODUCTION

This project employs transfer learning with MobileNetV2 to detect cracks in images efficiently. Leveraging the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model, we enhance crack detection
accuracy by adapting the model to our specific task. This approach streamlines development, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in simplifying and improving image classification tasks.

# OBJECTIVE
- Develop an architecture model for detecting a crack on a picture.
- Implementing transfer learning for better accuracy.
- Implement basic deep learning model to acquire high acuuracy model.
